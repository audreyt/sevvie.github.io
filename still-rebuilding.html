      <article><h2>The madness to my method</h2>
<p>I spent a late night hacking together some code, something utterly minimal and
more than just a little ugly, to get myself back on the road to programming. I
can&#39;t say I&#39;m proud of what I&#39;ve developed, but I can assuredly say that it
worked for creating this temporary html page.</p>
<p>The project I&#39;m attempting is a static blog generator, of sorts, but right now
it&#39;s more of a simple HTML page generator that doesn&#39;t bother me in the way
parsing <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a>, raw,
does. It&#39;s just some procedural <a href="http://livescript.net">LiveScript</a>, making use
of <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/js-yaml">JS-YAML</a>,
<a href="https://npmjs.org/package/marked">Marked</a>, and <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a>
for the parsing and generating of pages.</p>
<p>While the code itself will evolve over time, I felt like publicly embarrassing
myself by showing the code I&#39;m working with, here, in a blog post-like way, is
a good way to start the iterative process. So, without further regrets, the
code that generated this HTML page. (This page&#39;s source:
<a href="still-rebuilding.txt">still-rebuilding.txt</a>)</p>

<p>I lost a lot of hours this evening, writing this, and it was so worth it; even
if I&#39;m just gonna hate it tomorrow. A little bit at a time, and steady as she
goes.</p>
