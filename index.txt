## The madness to my method

I spent a late night hacking together some code, something utterly minimal and
more than just a little ugly, to get myself back on the road to programming. I
can't say I'm proud of what I've developed, but I can assuredly say that it
worked for creating this temporary html page.

The project I'm attempting is a static blog generator, of sorts, but right now
it's more of a simple HTML page generator that doesn't bother me in the way
parsing [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), raw,
does. It's just some procedural [LiveScript](http://livescript.net), making use
of [JS-YAML](https://npmjs.org/package/js-yaml),
[Marked](https://npmjs.org/package/marked), and [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/)
for the parsing and generating of pages.

While the code itself will evolve over time, I felt like publicly embarrassing
myself by showing the code I'm working with, here, in a blog post-like way, is
a good way to start the iterative process. So, without further regrets, the
code that generated this HTML page. (This page's source: [index.txt](index.txt))

```
global <<< require \prelude-ls
fs = require \fs
yaml = require \js-yaml
marked = require \marked
jade = require \jade

args = drop 2 process.argv

rawdoc = fs.readFileSync args.0 .to-string! .split "---\n"
rawdoc = drop 1 rawdoc

header = yaml.load rawdoc.0
content = marked rawdoc.1

jadetmpl = '''doctype 5
html(lang="en")
  head
    title= header.title
    link(rel="stylesheet", href="style.css")
  body
    header
      h1= header.title
      span By #{header.author}
    article!= content
'''

jadec = jade.compile jadetmpl, {pretty: true}
output = jadec {header: header, content: content}

fs.writeFileSync args.0.replace(".txt", ".html"), output
```

I lost a lot of hours this evening, writing this, and it was so worth it; even
if I'm just gonna hate it tomorrow. A little bit at a time, and steady as she
goes.
