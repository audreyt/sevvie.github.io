        <p>I’m a human who craves puzzles to solve. It’s a trope at this point; the
puzzle-hungry genius, but, my puzzles seem to be unlike anything anyone else
has ever seen. The puzzles I crave are so much larger, and usually assembled
upside-down, so to speak; I almost never know what I’m putting together until
it’s all in place. I haven’t given it much thought, in the meta, before now.
The lens of genius in the modern social eye focuses on obvious puzzles, such as
crime and mathematics, but being intelligent has two very expensive
necessities: the acceptance and the audience. The audience is important but
usually easy to find; without anyone to show one’s genius, there’s nothing with
which to compare it. The acceptance, though, that is perhaps where I differ
from others of intelligence — I didn’t have a proud youth to teach me to accept
the world around me as actively under my intelligent control. Instead,
acceptance had to come to me in the form of coping.</p>

<h3>Radical Acceptance</h3>

<p>My mother’s second husband was, in lacking any better words for it, an empty
human. He was devoid of feeling and attempted to fill himself with money,
control, violence and sex. It controlled him and he had no idea; but I was the
one who had no idea what his influence had done to me. It had begun to hollow
me out as well; given the opportunity he would have been the only puzzle I
would have had in life — I would have killed him and spent the rest of my life
dealing with what that would have done to me.</p>

<p>But instead, I was disowned and sent to military school, a military school that
was comparable to Guantanamo Bay, and I say that with absolutely no hyperbole.
Without choice, my identity and self were destroyed and replaced with a weapon
sometimes too dangerous to be given to children: duty and honor. I couldn’t
understand them then, even as intelligent as I was; they run so deep and burn
so intensely that studying them took more than a decade.</p>

<p>Following the military school were several injuries, all in different states
and countries; I lived my life as if I were invulnerable and bear the scars and
limp to prove the opposite. With a tolerance reserved for Irish dock-workers
and Russian spies, I drank and smoked myself into oblivion to stop the agony of
constantly feeling depleted, like a bucket turned at an angle and slowly
draining — I could smoke heroin and meth, and operate completely functionally;
however, it was when I was sober that people had the most to fear. I would use
the lucidity of intoxication to allow me the freedom to observe how disparate
and distant objects would connect, interact, intertwine, and I created stunning
pieces of software and art in that time, but no different than one of the women
and men who made me as I am, I was under its control. I grew more violent and
cruel in my sober moments, unable to contain the pain of hatred and
abandonment. California, Virginia, DC, New York, Alabama, North Texas, Oregon,
Eastern Washington, Germany and the UK had all seen the darkest parts of me
before I even came close to realizing that the problem existed within me, and
had existed long before even my memories.</p>

<p>It was in Spokane, Washington, that I was finally exposed to something that
could inspire more than just a hunger for something that wasn’t nothing, and I
called her Doc. She was utterly brilliant and, in her own way, just as broken
as I am — with one exception. Her success at work was only outshone by the
brilliance of her ability to hide the depths of her damage and vulnerabilities.
Until her, my life had no meaning, no value; but after her, there was a
connection in me that had not been made before. It came by helping her cheat on
her husband.</p>

<p>It sounds like a horrible thing to do at first glance, but his drug addiction
was worse than mine, and with it he had no control and no sense of the people
around him. I had been drained near to empty, but I was not completely empty; I
could understand their emotions but I too could understand the painful vacancy
that existed in that shell of a human who called himself a father. I could do
nothing for him, and I could do nothing for her children, but for her the
puzzle pieces just seemed to fall into place. My gift for mathematics and human
behaviors gave this beautiful, middle-aged statistician the hope and
understanding that comes with finding a person in which she could see herself.
Her puzzles, however, were integrals and the range of possibilities that
existed between 0 and 1. But for me, everything was about understanding her
world and her puzzles to see how it could be applied to as much of the world as
possible. She gave me a gift, but with time I learned it wasn’t the first gift
I was given. Certainly, many before then had come in tattered packaging and
with regrets too numerous to count, but a gift of the mind and soul cannot be
taken away, not entirely. She gave me Statistics.</p>

<p>In the years since I had last seen her, there have been others that have
imparted gifts to me; each one has been another puzzle piece. But my puzzles,
they are not pre-packaged and the functions used for fitting them together have
yet to be written. The pieces for them come from all different boxes and images
and tell all kinds of different stories. And though I fail quite often, one
day… one day all the pieces will fit together.</p>
