        <p>This began as a moment of free rambling at a beloved of mine, over texts. There
aren&#39;t many people in the world with whom I find comfort in their terseness but,
when he is of few words... I feel like I&#39;ve said something correct. There is a
strange and wonderful beauty, though, to our respective geniuses -- especially
when they dance together like a double helix climbing toward greater
understandings. I don&#39;t know about him, but that genius has always come with
an introspective question, and that question is always the same: &quot;Will I always
be like this?&quot; The answer, this time, is different.</p>

<h2>&quot;Yes, isn&#39;t it grand? Isn&#39;t it free?&quot;</h2>

<p>At eleven years old, I was being bred for an entrepreneurial future by both the
best and the shadiest of businessmen and white collar criminals -- and I was
soaking it up like a sponge. I was far too intelligent to be exposed to some of
the things to which I was; it sublimated and drifted up into my nose and
imprinted itself on my strongest memories. And both the upright and the criminal
showed themselves quite well, as I became more than those businessmen could
handle. By 17 years old, I had been in a military school for a number of years,
now being reared with a focus on a different selection and cultural lens on my
skills. Suffice it to say, this corrupt and abusive military school were the
first in a number of people who wished to weaponize the brilliance and grace
they had stumbled upon.</p>

<p>After it all, however, I made the youthful and exuberant choice of attempting
to handle absolutely all of it on my own. I tried to make myself human, and I
availed myself of all of the skills I had learned prior to accomplish that.
Watching everyone around me and learning from every faith and religion I could
study led to stunning misunderstandings and even forgeries of self -- taking
me to a place where getting into fights and chasing adrenaline highs caused
numerous injuries and memory problems, many of which still unsolved. And here
I stand now, after months, even years, of breaking myself down, observing
myself, fixing habits and accepting who I am, what I am, where I am.</p>

<h2>Mind, Body, Soul</h2>

<p>Despite the mistakes and outright horrid choices I&#39;ve made in my past, I see a
success amongst the chaos -- I did, in fact, succeed in making a whole person
out of myself. It was an ugly success, but a success nonetheless.</p>

<p>The past, though, is just wood, steel, iron, and other structural carbons; it
is what builds the temple that is oneself. We all have flaws in our pasts,
failings and faults. A roof and attic requires supporting walls, and if you
try to fix one wall, you&#39;ll likely need to add additional supports to maintain
the structure during repairs. However, there is more to a home than just the
walls and roof. A proper home has a yard, a garden -- a place that connects the
structure with the rest of the world around it, while setting clear boundaries.
It is from where your guests approach; it is natural and not completely under
one&#39;s control, with beautiful trees making their own patterns and marks
apparent.</p>

<p>Perhaps the body and soul&#39;s front yard is merely the interactions with which we
fill our days; the sharp and chaotic or calm and well-treated bushes and trees
growing right out front and yet, we notice them less and less as we adapt to
living with them. But even the smallest change is important -- trimming the rose
bush keeps it growing dense and beautiful, and cutting the limbs from some trees
keeps them from reaching into other people&#39;s yards and creating conflict.</p>

<h2>We&#39;ll See, said the Blind Zen Master</h2>

<p>It is with patience, and observation, that I take a remarkably horrible
situation and begin to shape lemonade off this tree of lemons I&#39;ve crashed into.
A rather spacious 2-bedroom unit in a duplex, and the lower-level unit, that
comes with the baggage of previous tenant&#39;s utility bills which went unpaid for
nearly a year, with a gorgeous yard in which Elty adores playing; this is what
will soon be my home.</p>
