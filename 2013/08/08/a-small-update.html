        <p>I&#39;ve temporarily switched over to Jekyll for developing my blog, though I&#39;m not
really using it the way Github wants me to, letting it be compiled on the
server-side. Instead I use <code>jekyll watch</code> to auto-build into my
<code>sevvie.github.io</code> directory, and write away. I also make use of a <code>_drafts</code>
directory, to store partial thoughts in for later editing and work.</p>

<p>All that being said; I can&#39;t stand <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll, Github&#39;s static blog generator">Jekyll</a>. It feels so half-assed,
compared to what it could be if given some love, some compersion from a
passionate individual or group of individuals. Even <a href="http://ruhoh.com/" title="Ruhoh, a slightly better static blog generator.">Ruhoh</a>, which wants to
solve Jekyll&#39;s problems, feels dry and limited, to me. Static Blog Generators
should be one of the next steps forward, given the nature of the web today;
with the numerous services today providing the <em>extensions</em> of blogging, like
Disqus, Twitter and Facebook, Search Engine Webmaster Tools with Google and
Bing, and the availability of important APIs like Statistics Tracking, one
barely needs a backend for a basic <em>blog</em> anymore. What they need, however, is
&quot;integration&quot; of important modern aspects of the web, such as automatically
embedding video links from YouTube and Vimeo or audio from Spotify, making use
of JavaScript on the frontend (but only where necessary), and the extensibility
to be able to add their own ideas, however one needs them.</p>

<p>Until then, however, I&#39;m still a person with no code to show for my words. There
is a little shame in that; however, it&#39;s a waste of my energy to feel that shame
because, as weird as it might be, I have to talk through my thoughts -- if even
just in a blog -- to get them shaped up enough to put into code. If you find that
interesting, that&#39;s awesome. If not? I&#39;ll just get back to my code, then.</p>
