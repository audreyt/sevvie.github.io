        <p>I&#39;m homeless. Writing this, I&#39;m in a hotel room, paid by a person who wishes to
never speak to me again, but in publishing it, I find myself stepping out into
an unknown that terrifies most. I&#39;ve been homeless this whole time though; at
least, for as long as I can remember which is, sad to say, not very long. I&#39;ve
been able to do a lot, before I had no resources or options left; but now, with
nowhere to turn and no one to call, I&#39;m looking for shelters in the area, that
will house Elty and I while the State tries to find me housing, or something
resembling it. And, in the quiet, I think about how I arrived where I am today.</p>

<h2>Broken Memories</h2>

<p>What follows is an account pieced together from people I&#39;ve been able to get to
talk to me, and was written down. They are my memories, rebuilt from scratch.</p>

<p>My mother was rather young, when she had me, and I was born into homelessness.
She did her best, on her own; put in that same situation, I would have made the
same mistakes she did. She worked as a maid in exchange for rent and a roof
over my head, though, and did her best to keep me safe -- it was, in the end,
the desperation that put her in the hands of a cruel and manipulative
psychopath.  I was rather quickly roped into his world, because of my genius. I
could operate the equipment and maintain the books at his one-hour photo shop.
I learned very quickly, and could remember almost anything. Around 11 years
old, I even took up an &#39;internship&#39; at a local computer sales and repair shop,
building and diagnosing computers in the back for their customers after school.</p>

<p>I was jumped from homeless to upper middle-class and did my best to take
advantage of what it had to offer, though I quickly found myself getting ahead
of everyone else. By sixth grade, I had skipped enough grades, and was young
enough that teachers and principals were concerned for my social development.
That, in combination with a California Standardized Test form filled out
entirely for its artistic merits, saw me held back a year. By the beginning of
the eighth grade, the problem of acceleration reared its ugly head again, and I
was skipped ahead into high school, with a dose of community college to fill in
any material I had skipped over.</p>

<p>The chaos toward the end, there, comes from problems at home that no one would
even begin to wish on another person. The psychopath mentioned before was
increasingly violent and cruel in his behaviours, getting very intoxicated
early in the days and running his four rapidly-failing photo shops as if
nothing were wrong at all. He came home and took out his anger on my mother and
I; I&#39;m told that I did my best in many cases to intercede on my mother or
sister&#39;s behalf, taking the abuse in order to let them get away. I don&#39;t
remember any of this, sadly; it&#39;s just the accounts of what few people with
whom I&#39;ve talked. When it was too calm, my mother would get very anxious and
take that out on me, for putting her in such complex positions, regarding both
school and her husband. Therapy wasn&#39;t working, and I was getting increasingly
chaotic and violent. I would run away without reason, finding friends with whom
to stay. I wanted out; I remember that much.</p>

<p>On one occasion, the situation at home became completely unhinged. I was
arrested and charged with multiple counts of assault with a deadly weapon, at
age 14. After juvenile hall, my mother tried many different reform schools; the
last of which being the Bethel Academy. A bounty-hunter was hired to trap and
&#39;arrest&#39; me, to take me to the military school, in Lucedale, MS.</p>

<p>I escaped his custody, in addition to everything else. It took him a while to
find me, but he did -- and he didn&#39;t make the mistake of taking the cuffs or
shackles off of me the next time. It didn&#39;t matter, in the long run; the home I
had been kicked out of would soon crumble of its own sins.</p>

<h2>Out of the smoke, into the fire</h2>

<p>A number of years were spent at the Bethel Academy, and I find it suffices to
say that the school always misrepresented itself in order to give itself a good
image in the eyes of parents in need of assistance. I know they did, because I
helped them. I did their print layouts for brochures, I designed their website
for a time and I even helped set up servers to keep the website up. I was also
often their electrician, tasked with running and splicing wire, setting up
panels and receptacles, and often in the summers of the bucolic South,
repairing the air conditioners. I was the subject of much ridicule, conspiracy,
and torture, in a prison where no outside information made it in without a
struggle.</p>

<p>Bethel Academy has a long history of child abuse, neglect, false imprisonment,
and forced labour. I haven&#39;t but flashes and partial images in memory, but most
are just too horrific to share. They wouldn&#39;t help explain anything, anyways;
they would just serve to dig in the wounds that deserve to heal.</p>

<p>I remember what I was doing when the planes struck the towers on September
11th.  The owner of the Bethel Academy frequently had me cleaning up or
otherwise remaining nearby, and he had specific things he liked done before he
arrived in the office for the morning; one of those things was having the
television running in the room next to his office. It was early, but not very
early; I turned on the television and just stared, and listened, and as my
brain put what little information there was together, I ran out to find
someone, anyone, to tell. When we had gotten back to the television, another
tower was being hit.</p>

<p>I remember when I found out my mother was in a battered-women&#39;s shelter. A call
was made to me and it was irregular to receive calls in the middle of the week,
especially when you didn&#39;t normally call home much at all. She couldn&#39;t stop
crying, and she honestly believed where I was, was a good place. The reality of
her situation took years to recover through, past that point. We&#39;ve kept in
touch, if just barely.</p>

<p>At some point, I was able to be too much of a problem for even this experienced
prison program to handle, and I was let out on my own recognizance. Using the
network and phone cables I helped run, and the computers I set up, I had
essentially freed myself; I exposed the weaknesses in their system. A scene was
made of casting me out. I couldn&#39;t turn to family, I knew no one, anywhere, and
I didn&#39;t know what to do.</p>

<h2>And then, six years had passed</h2>

<p>Anything past that point is fuzzy or blocked out. I don&#39;t remember how I got
to any of the numerous other places I ended up living in my early twenties. I
don&#39;t remember people who have an active and seething hatred of me, and I don&#39;t
remember working a lot of contract jobs that I have worked over the years. What
I remember starts around late 2008, when I found myself in a car with two young
women and a rather intimidating and creepy guy. I didn&#39;t know where or what or
who I was, but they seemed to; especially Mr. Creepy.  They called me &#39;Seven&#39;;
they said I had always been called Seven. We lived in an apartment in Tempe,
Arizona; doing what, I still don&#39;t quite know. I continued to black out, a lot,
and Mr. Creepy seemed to always be there when I came around. It wasn&#39;t a
comfort; it was most often very discomforting and upsetting. I continued to
grow upset with this reality I had found myself in, and on one night, I fled
the apartment with one suitcase and my cane, to Mr. Creepy saying, &quot;You&#39;ll be
back in a week.&quot;</p>

<p>How I convinced the hotel to give me time there, I don&#39;t know, but next came a
hotel. I used the hotel phone without abandon, calling any person I could find
on a laptop I had. I ended up getting ahold of one person, who got ahold of
another person, who talked to another person, and had their number passed back
to me. I was a crying, dizzy mess on the phone. The person I called ended up
gaining the nickname &quot;Doc&quot; as a way of helping store the memory of her a little
more concretely, and she transported me to Spokane, Washington. I never did end
up paying for that hotel stay.</p>

<p>There were months spent where I barely spoke to anyone. I was recovering from
more than I even know now, and I walked with a painful limp. Doc fed me and
took care of me; when she saw hints of life coming back to me, she brought me
with her to work at the Spokane campus of Eastern Washington University. For a
while, I had become a bit of an attache, in her presence; beautiful, quiet,
sitting and working in the back on heaven-knows-what. And, as the months went
on, the friendship and care Doc had provided had evolved into something more;
we hid it well, or at least imagined that we did, but the affair lasted for
quite a long time. Her children were smart enough to figure things out, but
it took her husband some time before he worked up the courage to yell in my
face.</p>

<p>While I didn&#39;t lose control, then and there, it ate at me; every bit of it did,
until soon I was just an angry mess. The savage volatility with which I adorned
myself grew sharper, and harsher, and less manageable until almost everyone had
just... left. And that they should have. I spent a number of months meditating
and trying to recover in the care of one friend, and when it became too much for
them, that friend passed me off to another.</p>

<h2>And then, in the last year...</h2>

<p>He was called the Gracious Benefactor, because he did everything he could to
spoil me, in hopes I would get better.</p>

<p>I spent a little more than a year in Canada, attempting to explore and photo-
document my experiences in this foreign land so close to home while making use
of their famed health care. When I did see the doctors, they pronounced that I
had a large malignant tumor. They suggested surgery, and the Gracious
Benefactor and I looked into surgery. The entire situation seemed so anxious,
so rushed; there was no talk of &quot;stages&quot; or invasive tests before the surgery.
They went in, cut a tumour out of a delicate and private place, and left me
with no information. I couldn&#39;t cope with it; I could barely understand it.</p>

<p>All of these people I&#39;ve given strange nicknames to, have seen a part of me
they wish they had never seen. I&#39;ve taken out my anxiety, panic, pain and
stress on them, and a good number of other people. In some cases, I&#39;ve behaved
completely unforgiveably. I&#39;ve hurt and scared people far beyond their
capability of understanding and then I&#39;ve pushed them harder. I&#39;ve taken what
people have told me in trust and love, and used it against them as a weapon.
I&#39;ve left out a lot of gruesome and triggering details, but that&#39;s one fact
that can&#39;t be left out.  I have been absolutely horrible. When I didn&#39;t know if
I was going to live or die with regards to cancer, I was worse than horrible.</p>

<p>Canada didn&#39;t seem to like an American using up all their medical resources, and
eventually stopped me from crossing at the border. I was so distraught, that the
Gracious Benefactor rented a house and helped me get a young dog to raise; that
is the Elty who is still with me, today. I had become demanding, and selfish, in
that time, denying my health and the love of the friends around me. My needs
grew ever-greater, nearly impossible to achieve in some respects. And then, I
was constantly withdrawn, and upset about something. I let the possibility of
death kill just about every good thing about me.</p>

<p>The Gracious Benefactor had had enough of me somewhere around the time he left
me without ride or really anything, at my therapist&#39;s office. I was taken to a
psychiatric clinic which mostly treated me like a medical patient, and they had
to let me out after two weeks; the Gracious Benefactor, after all he had seen
and put up with, paid for two months in a hotel for me to get things worked out
with the state. And while a lot of work has been done, housing hasn&#39;t been
figured out. I don&#39;t have the slightest clue about shelters in Washington.</p>

<h2>In conclusion...</h2>

<p>How did I get here? One might argue that I took advantage of a good thing, and
even abused the Gracious Benefactor, ending the rather cozy life I had, and I
wouldn&#39;t be in a position to argue. But there&#39;s a greater question at hand, one
that goes all the way back to the young, ambitious, somewhat eccentric genius.
The upper middle-class life comes with beliefs, and ideas, loosely based on the
hopes and dreams of the eighties; getting money fast and hard, from anywhere
you could get it, was everywhere around me. Welfare and accepting assistance
were utterly unspoken; we didn&#39;t have to worry about it with the rich foreign
husband around. And that&#39;s what it has always been, hasn&#39;t it? If I were
working, and doing well, I was frivolous in gifts and careless in planning.
When someone else made the money, I would make rather severe requests. I push
people away when the stress gets high, and grow manipulative. It was in being
absolutely sure that no one could hurt me like others hurt me before, that I
recreated the very cruelty I had experienced. If there was anyone to call for
help, I would, but I stand alone today. I pushed them all away.</p>

<p>I arrived here with every step in live I&#39;ve taken, whether I should have taken
that step or not.</p>

<p>I was recently declared disabled, by the state of Washington; there aren&#39;t very
many details in the letter I found on the hotel desk, but my disabilities are,
somehow, officialized. I have rather severe memory problems, and still walk with
a pretty painful limp, though I&#39;ve kinda grown to accept it. I had cancer before
I was even thirty years old, and my body never showed any of the signs that a
body normally shows, when it has cancer. And, after all the abuse I received,
and all the abuse I doled out, I still hadn&#39;t taken the time to recover from my
extreme and difficult circumstances, and heal up, and even the State agrees with
me. Working with the State is a lot of waiting, and a lot of paperwork, and a
lot of red tape, but at this point, I can wait. I can accept, and live with my
past, so long as I&#39;m keeping my mind active and exercised. I can do more than
live with it; I can live well, and I can live for my thoughts and ideas.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always had this brain; it&#39;s high time I used it.</p>

<h2>Postscript</h2>

<p>This isn&#39;t the last post I&#39;ll be writing, but it&#39;s the last one before I step
out and try to just take responsibility for myself, and my life. In the
meantime though, I&#39;m working on my programming; perhaps I can educate myself
into a better form. But even if I can&#39;t, the show must go on.</p>
