                <h2>Dipping into the Abstract</h2>
<p class="meta">05 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>There&#39;s a somewhat large chasm, in programming, that often goes unspoken;
somewhere between the designs and abstractions, and the tutorials at which one
begins, there are some extremely large leaps one must take. It can be made
easier, in the social and experimental atmosphere of college, to find oneself
making these large leaps, but if you find yourself doing it almost completely
alone it can be very intimidating. And you stand there, balanced on your
simple and procedural scripts, staring into the distance wondering how these
other programmers were able to create such elegance in what they&#39;ve put up
on Github, or the package-sharing repositories; what did they learn that
you didn&#39;t?</p>

<h2>As it turns out, nothing.</h2>

<p>Whether by culture, social environment, societal upbringing, good fortune,
or any other means, these brilliant programmers didn&#39;t actually have anything
more than the structured or unstructured repetition of increasingly-profound
and deeply logical experiences -- which is to say, practice. And unless a doctor-
confounding brain problem prevents you from remembering things, that practice
stays with you.</p>

<p>If you do have a doctor-confounding brain injury, though, and you&#39;re still
determined to program; Good! Take that determination to heart. Get mad, get
passionate about it, and don&#39;t let go of that passion for anything.</p>

<p>Writing things down and spending the time to associate different senses with
memories is a great place to start, with the memory problems; it might seem
frightening, because when you wake, or blink out, you can&#39;t always trust that
it was you that wrote these things, or that they&#39;re at all real. But this is
where that determination and passion come in; trust yourself, and take it in
tiny amounts and bursts. Let it happen naturally, both with writing down thoughts
and with writing out logical constructs in programming.</p>

<h2>Then, Shoot the Moon.</h2>

<p>Give it all you got. Make every mistake you can make, and write down your experiences.
If the past isn&#39;t readily-available, you build anew, and you practice absolutely
everything. If a bad day comes, and you can&#39;t remember, can&#39;t trust, can&#39;t understand
and the words come out of your mouth like screaming jibberish, have your bad day,
and then pick up where you left off on the day before it; take those two steps back
so you can get that one step forward.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter how ugly it is, and it doesn&#39;t matter how painful the experiences
can be, because they&#39;re your experiences -- they&#39;re your second chance at everything.
And that&#39;s for everyone, not just those with the debilitating brain problems; make it
ugly, and make that self-perceived ugliness with all the disdain you can feel --
that disdain and judgementality of your own works is what will drive you to only do
better. If you don&#39;t like it, re-write it. Edit it. Reshape and reform it. But never
take your eyes off the delusions in the distance, because with each day of practice,
you won&#39;t become more like those programmers you stare at off in the distance.</p>

<p>You will become more like yourself.</p>

<h2>You will become more like yourself.</h2>

<p>It bears repeating, because no matter what you know about yourself, and what limits
you, there are means and ways to accomplish things in a digital world. If you grow
frustrated with your blog engine, you can use the experience of rolling your own, from 
your own edited words, to give a tutorial in using Node.js, YAML, Markdown, Jade,
and Helmsman to get started with a blogging engine, or you could use it to reach out
and try to let people know; I&#39;ve been there before too, and I don&#39;t actually remember
ever being there before. I&#39;m there again, and the best of us tend to end up there
again anyway; it seems to be the Zen of it all.</p>

<p>Today&#39;s page is generated by a lot more small files, rather than one somewhat-hacky
script; it can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/sevvie/dujour">its github repository</a>.
Unlike <a href="https://gist.github.com/sevvie/6103301">yesterday</a>, a simple command was used 
to generate the page, that calls upon separate parts (A Parser, and a Renderer, which
basically wrap the real parsers and renderers in use): <code>dujour single filename.txt</code>.</p>

<p>As the program becomes more abstract, I&#39;ll try to speak more on the technical details
and all that geeky stuff; for now though, I hope you can share in the sense of zen.</p>
