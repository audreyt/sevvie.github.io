        <p>Of recent, some wisdom was imparted to me that, while somewhat jarring and
upsetting, was exactly what I needed to hear. They&#39;re perhaps the most
intelligent person I know, and they let me know that, if we were standing
together at the edge of a cliff with a length of rope, and I had the idea
to go rappelling, the first action he would take would be to assure that I had
secured the rope -- forward thinking isn&#39;t always my first virtue, when I am
excited by the merit of an idea, for better or for worse.</p>

<h2>The Wrong Kind of Smart</h2>

<p>I had, at first, taken it as being called, in so many words, &quot;stupid&quot;, but this
wasn&#39;t the kind of person to call me stupid at all. At some point, he ended up
describing me as &quot;the wrong kind of smart&quot;; a statement that, to itself, could
have meant anything.</p>

<p>Had he been anyone else, it might not have ended as well as it did.</p>

<p>The words have stuck with me, though, and the sentiment that comes from behind
them. I have a long history of risk-taking, and without very effective planning
or contingency or even well-diversified books to justify the risk. I&#39;ve spent so
much of my life seeking out survival, without success, that more advanced human
needs, and the experiences through which we learn these, are nearly out of my
reach, most of the time. I take leaps of faith, and I ask others to take those
leaps as well; as far as I can tell, most of those leaps have just left me
disabled.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to say I&#39;m stupid, though; through all my known and unknown
experiences, the pains I&#39;ve been through and caused, I have been in a state of
pure survival-need. I never got past that, I never learned how to be more, in
the chaos that has surrounded myself and my life. As far as I could tell, there
was no more; until very recently, I was remarkably ignorant of a lot of the ways
in which people operated. Everything in me seems so starkly broken and
different; but, that&#39;s me to the best of my understanding, so far.</p>

<p>In order to get past the basest of requirements in life, and experience that
which is required to learn, more and more, I will have to be able to plan ahead,
or at least behave in such a way that renders expectable and repeatable results
for the purpose of understanding what to keep in mind, what to reference or
remember, in future endeavours.</p>

<h2>Test-driven Development</h2>

<p>That was the kind of somewhat curcuitous thinking that helped me arrive at a
curious overlap in the matters I&#39;ve been studying of recent; test-driven design
and development seem to address the same kinds of issues, if within the confines
of a programming or development environment.</p>

<p>There are a lot of interesting abstract structures that test-driven development
uses, in order to convey intent, desire, and facts about the system they attempt
to cover: an <strong>acceptance</strong> or <strong>end-to-end test</strong> captures an overall view of
the application, providing a net of larger-scale truths that will eventually
remain true for the existence of the project; <strong>unit tests</strong> validate the larger
truths through smaller, targeted bits of logic and provide coverage of
individual moving parts that make up the larger interfaces used in acceptance
testing; and <strong>documentation</strong> breaks down, in simple words, the expectations of
each part, from its inputs and its outputs.</p>

<p>Through loops within loops, you structure and exercise the application by
clearly defining your expectations of the application, as it would be used in
the real world (however that may be), and use those definitions as immutable
truths on which to extend into features, and new versions. By laying out that
overlying expectation, and building to reinforce each assertion (or test
failure), there is created an accountability for what exists, and at least the
hints of a contract of what is to come, or currently under development. The
focus is then shifted down to the nitty-gritty details, themselves, setting up
a smaller expectation for inputs and outputs, building the machine that takes
those inputs and provides the expected output, and then analyzing that machine
to see if it is, in fact, made up of smaller machines, all the while keeping in
the back of your mind that these machines need to connect together, in order to
meet the expectations of the larger acceptance assertions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s meticulous, and that careful work can render stunning results, from
individuals to large teams of programmers, with project handlers and expectant
clients and stakeholders, to some very impressive open-source code out there.
Who&#39;s to say it wouldn&#39;t necessarily be able to be deconstructed, for the
purpose of structuring something in myself greater than a problem for myself and
others?</p>

<h2>Test-driven... Life?</h2>

<p>Breaking it down leaves me with one very simple set of concepts, and to anyone
else, it might seem like I took far too long a road, to arrive at something so
simple. But the simplicity of it, to me, is the complexity of it; either I take
the responsibility and follow through on it and make it work, or I really am
just stupid.</p>

<p>Just as before, three important concepts build up the test-driven life, each
relying and providing where the other types of mental focus cannot render
effective results. The <strong>structural goals</strong> represent the expectations and needs
I have for myself within the legal and social bounds of the society to which I&#39;m
exposed; a simple set of assertions under which, so long as they remain true,
forward momentum and advancement in life can be achieved. These structural goals
are broken down and given focus through <strong>exercise goals</strong>, which outline
assertions for each individual day; a simple list of four or five goals to
accomplish in the day with respect to structural goals. In determining each of
the exercise goals, things which have been put off, or are large enough to need
their own structural goal, should be documented in a <strong>daily log</strong>, in addition
to the success or failure of each exercise goal.</p>

<p>And the loop within a loop begins, laying out such goals as &quot;don&#39;t be an
asshole&quot;, and &quot;keep to your sleep schedule&quot;, and &quot;follow through with DSHS and
Social Security&quot;, each of them requiring special attention to their specific
requirements. No one ever said it started pretty, but with each set of exercise
goals, kept in the daily log, I can build more than just an external history
reference for myself, and therethrough begin remembering things more clearly;
I can take simple, logical steps each day toward improving my life, improving
myself, and accomplishing my goals.</p>

<h2>Test Results: FAIL</h2>

<p>And what happens when I do fail an assertion, as I&#39;ve put it? One can never let
anything interfere with their goals and dreams, and therefore, I just attempt to
think through things, gain perspective for myself and of others, and handle it
differently next time. With a note in the daily log, I carry on, being sure the
rest of the assertions pass that day. If it proves to be a persistent problem,
then we kick it upward to a larger loop, such as the structural goals, and begin
taking it apart, one piece at a time, until we&#39;ve worked through that wholly.
Rushing by taking on too many exercise goals would be counter-productive, so
such concerns should be analyzed over a number of days while planning out the
day&#39;s exercise goals.</p>

<p>No one ever meets all the expectations, all the time, and no one gets out alive.
If all I&#39;ve got is this life, then I&#39;d like to take it to the best of my ability
and not the worst of my disabilities and emotions -- I&#39;d like to live completely
and fully. My brain may work weird, but it&#39;s just the wrong kind of smart --
the kind of smart that creates something like this.</p>
