        <p>Sometimes, the world will be falling apart and breaking down around you. It&#39;s
important to retain your cool and mind your own interests, at times like this;
otherwise, you might find yourself sucked up in the sheer madness of others.
It&#39;s been much longer than I had intended, to get around to writing this piece;
it depended upon my obtaining a place of residence, and until now, I really
haven&#39;t had anything truly solid. Today, though, on 9 October, I am settled into
a temporary room, and my small apartment is being cleaned out by the previous
tenants.</p>

<h2>Breaking Boring</h2>

<p>For all the excitement of finding a situation in which my past rental history is
of less importance than my understanding of legal matters and willingness to be
helpful where I can, I find myself making a remarkably interesting decision at
this point in my life; I&#39;m settling in somewhere, and growing roots. Of all the
crazed, wanderlusting travel in my life, and the extents to which I wish to live
what life I have left, I didn&#39;t really have another choice, and yet, it&#39;s such
a change for me.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a duplex building high up on a hill, which overlooks the Boeing Propulsion
Labs and the beauty of South Seattle. My unit is the bottom unit, however the
girls who are moving out had still left everything down there; so, I&#39;m sleeping
in a room up in the upper unit while the girls drag their feet. The view is
stunning, in the sun, rain, or night-time, but getting around isn&#39;t terribly
easy. I ended up falling off my electric bike, attempting to use it as a means
to conquer these hills; there&#39;s no additional damage but my entire left side
still hurts. I find myself somewhat stuck; I hope with time to figure out a
better means of getting down and up these hills than calling a cab and losing
my phone inside it.</p>

<p>Are cabbies allowed to charge you $20 to return your phone lost in their car? I
felt rather extorted in the moment. At least he gave me the phone before he
started to ask for money.</p>

<p>Photos to come, in time. I need CSS for them.</p>
