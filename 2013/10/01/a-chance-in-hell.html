        <p>Patience is a virtue best served cold. I think that&#39;s how the proverb goes.
Whatever it is, the patience, prudence and temperance I have worked in myself
and worked to show, in the last months, is beginning to pay off. I just didn&#39;t
know, earlier today, or any of the days prior. What I did know, and continue to
find out, is that I have some rather wonderful friends in the area, and that
everyone is stretched very thin as it is. The government shutdown began today,
marking yet another milestone in stupidity for the country I call home. No one
makes enough money, no one is in a good position right now.</p>

<h2>It makes me feel horrid</h2>

<p>... that the rest of the world is doing so terribly as well. I&#39;ve been selfish,
in my life, but never so selfish as to ignore a trend or pattern. The fact I&#39;ve
been lucky enough to find what I have -- a small apartment for $400/mo -- seems
to fall by the wayside rather quickly; it is to say, we&#39;ll see how great it
really is, and in the meantime, what can I do to make life easier for others in
a time where everything only seems to be getting harder?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like this apartment is just a cake-walk; it has taken me weeks to get
ahold of the landlord of the duplex, and in the end I and the other approaching
tenant had to stand our ground and say, &quot;We won&#39;t be paying rent this month;
instead, we will be paying off the power company debt that you refused to pay
after some bad tenants.&quot; Scary as it was to put myself in that position, it
worked. I had to ask for some help to keep the hotel a little longer as well,
to be sure this all goes according to plan.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m one of the lucky ones, based on talks with social workers, case managers
and people who work with SSI and SSD; the fact I was able to find a place, let
alone negotiate a deal to make the house liveable, and for such an affordable
price, is nearly unheard of in Seattle these days -- and it&#39;s like that in all
the mega-metropolitan areas in the United States.</p>

<h2>Take care of yourself first</h2>

<p>It&#39;s advice that becomes more and more necessary as time goes on; government and
the stock market are such great and passionate gambles and you just don&#39;t know
when someone from those worlds is going to get upset at someone else&#39;s fortunes
and try to flip the table over. Nothing in this world is as secure as we would
have hoped they would be, listening to Frank Sinatra at Christmastime for the
last 60-someodd years and living in hallucinations of a post-World War 2
prosperity, but that doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t have anything at all.</p>

<p>If I hadn&#39;t kept my wits about me, and remained calm, I could have lost a lot of
great opportunities, including the one I&#39;m taking now, for all its short-term
flaws. If I hadn&#39;t taken what was necessary into my own hands and make the
additional, sometimes stressful, decisions I&#39;ve had to make, I would have never
made the new friends I&#39;ve made. I&#39;ll have a safe place, for me and my puppy,
and I&#39;ll have ways to make money, to keep this period of disability from being
too uncomfortable.</p>

<h2>Thank you.</h2>

<p>Thank you to everyone who believed in me, and stood by me while I worked through
all of this. Thank you to the one who kept me safe in a hotel while I got some
off-books work and searched for a home, despite all the emotional stress that
had been endured before, because of me. Thank you to the ones who listen when
I talk, and remind me that I&#39;m not good or bad; I&#39;m just a person. Thank you for
the support; because of you this is all just the beginning.</p>

<p>Once I get my life sorted, and a regular pattern of sustaining myself, I&#39;ll be
in a much better position; I&#39;ll be able to be there for people, in these hard
times.</p>
