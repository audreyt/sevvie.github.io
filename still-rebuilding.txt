## The madness to my method

I spent a late night hacking together some code, something utterly minimal and
more than just a little ugly, to get myself back on the road to programming. I
can't say I'm proud of what I've developed, but I can assuredly say that it
worked for creating this temporary html page.

The project I'm attempting is a static blog generator, of sorts, but right now
it's more of a simple HTML page generator that doesn't bother me in the way
parsing [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), raw,
does. It's just some procedural [LiveScript](http://livescript.net), making use
of [JS-YAML](https://npmjs.org/package/js-yaml),
[Marked](https://npmjs.org/package/marked), and [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/)
for the parsing and generating of pages.

While the code itself will evolve over time, I felt like publicly embarrassing
myself by showing the code I'm working with, here, in a blog post-like way, is
a good way to start the iterative process. So, without further regrets, the
code that generated this HTML page. (This page's source:

I lost a lot of hours this evening, writing this, and it was so worth it; even
if I'm just gonna hate it tomorrow. A little bit at a time, and steady as she
goes.
